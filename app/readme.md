### Raspberry-Pi Smart Mirror Web App/API

**Disclaimer**

This is a personal project so I can mostly learn about the Raspberry-Pi(s) that I own but use for nothing. 

#### Description

This app is the web endpoint for getting data to display on the mirror. The controller methods will simply validate a request for data and return a JSON object with everything you'll need for a widget.

The widgets I have come up with so far will be:
* A clock, with various phrases for different times of the day (11:11 -> make a wish, 3:00am -> why are you still awake?, etc.)
* Calendar with the ability to sync to your gmail calenders to show you what you have today
* Weather for your location or various citites
* Moon phases
* ISS (International Space Station) data, location, will it pass overhead, etc.
* more to come..
